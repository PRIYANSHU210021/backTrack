## 📌 backTrack - DSA Reminder Chrome Extension

> *"Every solved problem, one step back to revise."*

`backTrack` is a minimal Chrome Extension built to help you keep track of your solved coding problems and set revision reminders using simple spaced repetition intervals.
It’s built entirely using vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** – no frameworks.

---

###  Why I built this

As a DSA learner, I realized that solving a problem once isn’t enough — **consistent revision** is key to mastery.
`backTrack` helps you stay on top of your solved problems using a built-in streak and revision system.

Special thanks to:

* **ChatGPT**, for helping me understand Chrome Extension architecture.
* **My friend X**, for helping debug and polish the features.
